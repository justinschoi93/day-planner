## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://justinschoi93.github.io/dayjs-calendar/)

I modified a day planner to make it more functional. The save button now saves the text in the textarea to localStorage, and data from localStorage is retrieved and displayed when the page is refreshed.  


## Usage 

Click on the time-block you'd like to update/change. Make updates/changes. Click the save button to save changes. The rest will take care of itself!

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

## Learning Points 

Working on this project was the perfect opportunity to practice using jQuery and third party APIs (localStorage). By using jQuery, I was able to write functional code, a lot more effectively than I would've been able to using plain js.
